# [![4Geeks Logo](https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=4geeks,16 "4Geeks Logo")](https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=4geeks,16 "4Geeks Logo") Traffic Light With React / Javascript / CSS / Bootstrap.

## To-Dos:

Simulate a traffic light.

-   The light has to glow when clicked.

-   The whole purpose of the component is displaying a traffic light with red, yellow and green lights.

-   When any light is clicked (selected) it has to glow, but the other lights have to stop glowing.

-   The component must have a hooked state variable that tracks the color:

-   Use the setColor function to change the color and the component will automatically re-render (because it's hooked with useState).
